OVERVIEW
The overview of this project provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Also users can filter by city, state, country, and shape. This project also includes studying JavaScript and looking into its technical parts to see how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization.

RESULTS
To use this new web page and the data in it please enter your search criteria on the left under filter search and press enter. This will iterate through the table on the right. The table on the right is a raw data that we found and we've given the site the tools in order to filter through this data.

SUMMARY
Though the site is informational and exciting to use there could be design improvements made to help. Consider the filter search active so that the user does not have to press enter to see the results. Future recommendations would include a richer filter search area and more interactivity to the website may be linking it to other UFO websites for further research.
